    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I'm originally from Georgia. I was technically born in the US to secure my
      citizenship, however, I was raised in Georgia until I was 5 years old.
      <br />
      I entered medical school in 2020, however, I dropped out and currently I'm
      pursuing a career in software engineering. <br />
      On the side, I currently tutor in science topics (Biochemistry,
      Physiology, Genetics, etc. ) and starting up my youtube channel based on
      that. Here is the link below if you're interested:

    <h3>Preparing For The Trip</h3>
    <p>
      Main things I did to prepare was:
      <ul>
        <li>Brush up on my Georgian (the link to my
          Georgian flashcards is 
          <a href="https://quizlet.com/607590573/georgian-flash-cards/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
        <li>Packed up for a month-long stay</li>
        <li>Strategized on what diet I would go on. I decided to go keto during my time there</li>
      </ul> 
    </p>
